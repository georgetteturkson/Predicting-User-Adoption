Predicting User Adoption Using Python 

About: This is an exiting project where I combine my analytical skills and product skills to inform the future development of a software product! The company whose this data belongs to  was anonymized. Originally, the data is to serve as a take-
purpose of this assignment is to predict future user adoption using Python but I decided to use this data to practice my Tableau skills. 

Project Status: I succesfully built models in Python and identified three interesting themes- top 3 factors that lead to user adoption is 
'last_session_time', 'org_id' and 'invited_by_user_id'. Currently, I am building a dashboard in Tableau to analyze metrics including adoption rate in a year-to-analysis, weekly session trends and activation rate. 
While the data is great, I wish more information was provided about features of the apps to better understand certain user behavior. 

Learning: Creating the dashboard in Tableau (link in resume) has been eye-opening. I have to handle different date and time data and a merged dataset and think of new ways to disect the problem and questions when 
analyzing the data but I have been learning so much so that's great! Stay tuned, I should post an update soon. You are welcome to reach out to me with any feedback etc.
